Within this project, I investigated the efficiency of linear searches and dictionaries, exploring the impact performance can have on results and visualising my findings using 
the matplotlib library. After establishing which algorithm was the most efficient, I utilised the best one to extend the functionality of my recommendation system, allowing the 
user to receive more personal movie recommendations based on their watch history on a third party app, letterboxd. Not only did I investigate the importance of considering 
complexity in large programs, especially when handling large datasets such as the movie dataset I utilised, but I also showcased the importance of testing, discovering findings 
that I would not have otherwise found had I not tested my program multiple times.
